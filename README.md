# Sentari Task Extractor

This project extracts **actionable tasks** from natural language diary or transcript entries using TypeScript. It was built as part of the Sentari interview challenge.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Detects **actionable intent** using common verbs and time expressions
- 📆 Extracts structured fields:
  - `task_text`: full task phrase
  - `due_date`: relative or absolute date (e.g., “tomorrow”, “by July”)
  - `status`: defaulted to `"pending"`
  - `category`: inferred context like `health`, `home`, `work`, etc.
  - `priority`: derived from urgency indicators (`low`, `medium`, `high`)
- 🧪 Unit-tested with **>90% coverage** using Vitest

🧠 Explain Your Thinking
How do you detect actionable intent?

Actionable intent is detected using a combination of:
	• Task-oriented verbs (e.g., call, schedule, submit, organize) matched via a curated set of keywords.
	• Sentence segmentation to isolate individual actions from compound statements.
	• Contextual clues (e.g., “I need to…”, “I should…”) that indicate the user is expressing a plan or intention.
This approach allows the parser to filter meaningful tasks from casual or reflective statements.

### How do you detect actionable intent?

Actionable intent is detected using a combination of:

- **Task-oriented verbs** (e.g., *call*, *schedule*, *submit*, *organize*) matched via a curated set of keywords.
- **Sentence segmentation** to isolate individual actions from compound statements.
- **Contextual clues** (e.g., “I need to…”, “I should…”) that indicate the user is expressing a plan or intention.

This approach allows the parser to filter meaningful tasks from casual or reflective statements.

### Why this structure?

The output format includes:

- `task_text`: the extracted actionable phrase  
- `due_date`: relative or absolute, parsed from natural language  
- `status`: defaulted to `"pending"`  
- `category`: inferred from keywords (e.g., “doctor” → `health`)  
- `priority`: optional, based on urgency indicators  

This structure is:

- Cleanly aligned with typical to-do list schema and Supabase integration  
- Scalable for filtering, summarizing, or displaying in UI  
- Future-proof — easily supports extensions like reminders, calendar sync, or insights  

---

### How would this integrate into reminders or summaries?

With the structured task data:

- A **reminder system** can trigger notifications based on `due_date` and `priority`
- A **daily or weekly summary** can group tasks by category (e.g., `health`, `home`) or urgency
- The system could even generate insights like: _“You’ve scheduled 5 work tasks this week”_
